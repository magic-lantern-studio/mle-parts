# ismdefs - ISM definitions and macros
#
# All Makefiles in an ISM should include ismdefs. Following the first
# target in the Makefile $(ISMRULES) should be included. These files
# will in turn include commondefs and commonrules so there is no need
# to explicitly include these files. Each Makefile must define the
# ISM_DEPTH as the relative path to the top of the ISM. In addition
# Makefiles that build software should define CONFIGURATION as one
# of the standard configurations found in
# $MLE_ROOT/include/make/configurations. Thus, a typical Makefile will
# look like:
#
# CONFIGURATION = ConsoleRelease
# ISM_DEPTH = ../..
# include $(ISM_DEPTH)/ismdefs
# .
# .
# .
# default: $(TARGETS)
#
# include $(ISMRULES)
#
# Please refer to the commondefs file for detail information.

# If you want to force the build of only one version of the ISM
# you can either define an environment variable PREF_VERSION set
# to the desired version or uncomment PREF_VERSION below and set
# it to the version to be built. By default all versions are built
#
ifndef PREF_VERSION
#PREF_VERSION = <specific version name here>
endif 

#
# Location of MLE_ROOT environment.  Override by defining MLE_ROOT.
#
ifndef MLE_ROOT
MLE_ROOT = C:\Program Files\WizzerWorks\MagicLantern
endif
